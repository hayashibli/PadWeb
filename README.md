**Project Description**

A website that simulate the iPad general look and icons with some functionality in each icon (app). Our project change the usual structure and design of websites as well as it can contain multiple different ideas and websites within it. It's an entertainment website so it will be so helpful to the user because the structure of the website has the flavor of the iPad. The MVP for our project is to make a full website of apps including one app with full functionality.
